"""
The server is assumed secure, and only the client needs to be authenticated.
Authentication is based on the challenge/response mechanism, used in cellular networks.
Upon receiving HELLO (Client-ID-A), the server looks up Client Aâ€™s secret key K_A.
Then it generates a random number rand. Rand and K_A are input into an authentication algorithm A3.
The output, XRES, is stored by the server. Then the server sends rand in the CHALLENGE (rand).
Client A is expected to run the same algorithm A3 with the same inputs rand and K_A, and produce RES, which is sent to the server in the RESPONSE (Res) message.
If RES matches XRES, the server has authenticated the client. For this assignment, use a hash function for algorithm A3: RES = hash1(rand + K_A), where + denotes concatenation.
Examples are MD5, SHA1, SHA256 etc.
